# SQL-Project

Project Description
The domain that weâ€™re going to model is video games. We will focus on video game information
from a marketing perspective and sales data.
Database Specification
This database will focus on games, including ratings, awards, sales data, and other general
information about games. There will be purchase records of each game that highlights the
original price and discount rate, and game characteristics stored in the database. Such data will
assist firms that intend to invest in the video game industry in making business decisions, and
help developers review previously published editions to make further improvements.
We intend to provide three classes of users of the system: employees, investment firms, and
game developers. Employees will be able to access and update data in the entire database.
Investment firms will be able to access all data except customer private information. Developers
have access to data concerning their games and the customers who purchased them.

table.sql contains sql statements that create tables and initial instances.

project.php implements a webpage that serves as a user interface.
